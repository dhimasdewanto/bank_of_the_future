# Bank of the Future

Welcome to GIN Finans. Manage and track your accounts on the go.

## Nature of the Game

We want to understand how you think as a programmer, and the level of craft you bring to bear
when building software.

Of course, the ideal would be a real world problem, with real scale, but that isn’t practical as it
would take too much time. So instead we have a dead simple screen to implement in Flutter.

Please note that not following the instructions below will result in an automated rejection. Taking
longer than the time allocated will negatively affect our evaluation of your submission.

## Rules of the Game

1. You have two full days to implement a solution.
2. We are really, really interested in your object oriented or functional design skills, so please
craft the most beautiful code you can.
3. We’re also interested in understanding how you make assumptions when building screens. If
a particular workflow or boundary condition is not defined in the problem statement below, what
you do is your choice.
4. You have to solve the problem in Flutter without using any external libraries apart from
material and cupertino. Your solution must ios and android runner +run.
5. Please use Git for version control. We expect you to send us a repository link of your
codebase so we can look at your commit logs and understand how your solution evolved.
Frequent commits are a huge plus

## Problem Statement

You are registering as a new user in a platform and are required to fill out the following
information mentioned in the screens. There is a progress menu on top of the screen and it
updates on completion of each screen.

Each screen should have validation as per the provided fields and they must be filled before
proceeding to the next screen. Make your assumptions for the fields/ design.
